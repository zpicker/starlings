# starlings

Starlings', audiovisual installation, python.

Real-time simulation of starling flocking, loosely based on this paper:https://academic.oup.com/beheco/article/21/6/1349/333856

Starlings respond to audio input and various aesthetic effects are layered.

I actually figured out classes and various other nice technical things this time, so the code is significantly quicker and more legible than previous projects. I also had to come up with some neat tricks to make it efficient enough for real-time simulation. Simulation is 2D only, for aesthetic rather than technical reasons. The parameters are significantly tweaked from the real physics parameters in the above paper, also for real-time simulation/aesthetic reasons.

(may update this readme later if I have time)
